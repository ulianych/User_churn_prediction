# Prediction of user churn
## Description
The aim of this project is to analyze user churn in a telecommunications company. The task involves predicting whether a customer will churn (cancel their subscription) based on various features such as client period, monthly spending, total spent, demographics, services subscribed, and payment methods. By understanding the factors that contribute to customer churn, the company can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.
